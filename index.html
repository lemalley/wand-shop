        <h1>Welcome to the Wonderful World of Wands!<br>
        <p> You will find all you need to know (and then some) about what goes into the making of a magic wand. There are many intricacies, and those 
            who devote their lives to this mystical art still do not fathom some of the murkier, nuanced interplays between the wood, the core and
            the wizard who wields it. <br>
            <br>
            You will also have the opportunity to find the perfect wand for you by taking our quiz, and finding out what kind of wizard you are.<br>
            <br>
            Welcome, witches, and wizards to your journey into the wonderful world of wands!
